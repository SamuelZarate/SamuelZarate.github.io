### CPSC Labs

* Lab 6

The reason I liked this lab is the blackjack part, it was fun to code and seeing how a simple game is coded. Seeing how all these difAlso, seeing how all the different functions worked together and different functions was interesting to do.

* Lab 9

Part 1 of this lab was my favorite and interesting to do, see how you can get the average from the numbers the user puts in. Also, seeing how the program is able to do this and can be applied to real life situations is what makes it my favorite as well.

* Lab 10

This lab was my favorite since we learned how to access files and go through them. Being able to create a program that can sort prime numbers is very useful and could be used for other things. One example I can think of is sorting names alphabetically and applying to different lists to get results fast.
